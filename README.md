# password generator

## Description

  This project creates a handy tool to help you automatically generate a password.  
  Using this to select not only how long but what type of characters by type that will be used in the password. 
  I really enjoyed myself while creating this algorithm and the error handling in javascript. 
  It helped show the thought behind even a simple code and the many steps to completing a well developed application.
